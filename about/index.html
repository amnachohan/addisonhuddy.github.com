	<p>Welcome my blog, a place for me to write about my ideas and tell gloried tales of my adventures.</p>
	
	<p>A bit about myself: my name is Addison, and, currently, I’m an intrepeneur in Visa’s Data group and a Big Data evangelist (despite hating the term Big Data).  

	<p>I am passionate about financial services products and believe in simplifying one's relationship with money using technology.  I hope that in the future, earning, saving, spending, and investing money will be as simple and automated as possible. </p>
	
	<p>I enjoy exploring way outside the box and always have a hack or two I’m working on.
	I am a mentor with the San Francisco chapter of Big Brother Big Sisters, an avid Triathete, and really really like coffee.</p>

	<p>If you ever want to grab a cup, hit me up.</p>
