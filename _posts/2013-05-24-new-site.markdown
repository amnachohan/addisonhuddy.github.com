Excited to now being using Jekyll to power my blog.  The startup costs are high, however, it does give me a lot of freedom and flexibility.  The downside is that the framework is a bit confusing, too me a few hours to fully get it.

Hoping to use this site for whatever I have on my mind.

Let me know what you think . . .
